Requirements
-----------------

This activity module works only with Moodle 2.x 

The import functionality needs 'xmlreader' in order to function properly. Please make sure that 'xmlreader' is enabled on your server.
Please make sure you have the 'php_zip' extension enabled. If it is disabled the presenter mod will try to run linux shell commands with exec to zip/unzip.


New install
-----------
Put the folder presenter inside your /moodle/mod directory. 

Put the lang files, from /lang directory to the corresponding /moodle/lang directories, for each lang. 

From the admin page, click on the 'Notifications' link (it's in the left side) - all the tables required for this module
will be created and the module will be installed.



Update from an older version of Moodle Pesenter
--------------------------------------------------
Simply overwrite the files in the /moodle/mod/presenter directory with the new files. 

Overwrite the lang files from /moodle/lang directory with the corespoding file from the /lang directory.

All your old settings will be preserved.
